Project Overview

Our team aims to conduct an exploratory data analysis on three significant cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Dogecoin (DOGE). The project will be structured around the following three topics:

1. Seasonality Analysis in Cryptocurrency Markets

Objective: To identify any seasonal patterns in the cryptocurrency market, focusing on the best and worst performing months historically for BTC, ETH, and DOGE.
Approach: Analyze historical monthly price data to detect patterns of seasonality and assess if certain months consistently show higher or lower returns.

2. Analysis of Bitcoin Halving Events
Objective: Investigate the impact of Bitcoin halving events on BTC's price and potential influences on the broader cryptocurrency market.
Approach: Examine historical price trends around BTC halving dates and compare market behaviors during these periods to non-halving periods.

3. Comparative Analysis in Bull and Bear Markets
Objective: Explore the relationships between BTC, ETH, and DOGE during different market conditions, particularly in bull and bear markets.
Approach: Conduct a comparative analysis of price movements, trading volumes, and market volatility across these cryptocurrencies during various market phases.

Data and Methodology
Utilize historical price data, including monthly closing prices, for BTC, ETH, and DOGE.
Employ statistical methods to analyze seasonal trends and identify recurring patterns.
Comparative analysis will be used to examine the different behaviors of cryptocurrencies in varying market conditions.

Expected Outcomes
Insights into seasonal trends in the cryptocurrency market.
Understanding of the effects of BTC halving events on cryptocurrency prices.
Comparative insights into how different cryptocurrencies behave during bull and bear market phases.

Final Deliverables
A comprehensive report detailing our findings, supported by statistical analysis and data visualizations.
An in-class presentation summarizing the key insights and methodologies.
